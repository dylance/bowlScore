# Bowling Score Function

This is one of the tougher problems I solved on code wars so wanted to upload it to my github.

The function calculates a bowling score. The input is a string with each frame separated by a space.

### Possible Improvements
* create error checking
* keep score of incomplete game
* include more than just the score in result. ie: messages
